- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DS3ttx, here is really starting my journey as a developer. 
  Previously I didn't know a clear path on how to accomplish this, from now on all my projects will be valuable and treated with great care and attention.

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games, hacking, security information and sports.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science in Federal University of Minas Gerais.
